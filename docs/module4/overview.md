# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Introduction

The convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotics represents the future of human-robot interaction. Vision-Language-Action models enable robots to understand natural language, perceive their environment, and take appropriate actions.

## Module Focus

**The convergence of LLMs and Robotics** - Bridge natural language understanding with physical actions.

## What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts

1. **Voice-to-Action**
   - Speech recognition (OpenAI Whisper)
   - Natural language understanding
   - Action mapping
   - Voice feedback

2. **Cognitive Planning**
   - LLM-based task planning
   - Breaking down complex commands
   - Context awareness
   - Error recovery

3. **Multimodal Integration**
   - Vision + Language + Action
   - Scene understanding
   - Object manipulation
   - Human-robot collaboration

## Timeline: Weeks 11-13

### Week 11: Voice Interface
- Speech-to-text integration
- Command parsing
- Natural language processing
- Voice synthesis

### Week 12: LLM Integration
- GPT-4 for robotics
- Prompt engineering
- Action sequence generation
- Safety constraints

### Week 13: Capstone Project
- Complete system integration
- Testing and refinement
- Documentation
- Final presentation

## The VLA Pipeline

```
Voice Command → Speech Recognition → LLM Planning → 
Action Sequence → Robot Execution → Visual Feedback → 
Voice Response
```

## Example Scenarios

### "Clean the room"
1. **Understand**: Parse command intent
2. **Plan**: Identify objects, plan path
3. **Execute**: Navigate, grasp, place
4. **Verify**: Check completion
5. **Report**: "Room cleaned"

### "Bring me the red cup"
1. **Perceive**: Detect objects, identify red cup
2. **Plan**: Path to cup, grasp strategy
3. **Navigate**: Move to cup location
4. **Manipulate**: Grasp cup
5. **Deliver**: Bring to user

## Technologies

- **OpenAI Whisper** - Speech recognition
- **GPT-4** - Language understanding
- **CLIP** - Vision-language models
- **ROS 2 Actions** - Task execution
- **MoveIt 2** - Motion planning

## Capstone Project

### The Autonomous Humanoid

Your final project integrates everything:
- Voice command interface
- LLM-based planning
- Computer vision
- Navigation
- Manipulation

**Goal**: Create a robot that can understand and execute complex, multi-step commands in natural language.
