# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Introduction

Just as the nervous system coordinates all activities in the human body, **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)** serves as the communication backbone for robotic systems. This module introduces you to the middleware that powers modern robotics.

## Module Focus

**Middleware for robot control** - Learn how different components of a robot communicate, coordinate, and work together seamlessly.

## What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts

1. **ROS 2 Architecture**
   - Understanding the publish-subscribe model
   - Service-based communication
   - Action servers for long-running tasks

2. **ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services**
   - Creating and managing nodes
   - Publishing and subscribing to topics
   - Implementing services for request-response patterns

3. **Python Integration with rclpy**
   - Bridging Python AI agents to ROS controllers
   - Writing ROS 2 nodes in Python
   - Integrating AI models with robotic control

4. **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**
   - Describing humanoid robot structure
   - Defining joints, links, and kinematics
   - Visualizing robots in RViz2

## Timeline: Weeks 1-5

### Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI
- Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- From digital AI to robots that understand physical laws
- Overview of humanoid robotics landscape
- Sensor systems: LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors

### Weeks 3-5: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Building ROS 2 packages with Python
- Launch files and parameter management

## Key Technologies

- **ROS 2 Humble** (or latest LTS version)
- **Python 3.10+**
- **rclpy** - ROS 2 Python client library
- **colcon** - Build system for ROS 2
- **RViz2** - 3D visualization tool

## Practical Skills

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Set up a ROS 2 development environment
- ✅ Create and manage ROS 2 nodes
